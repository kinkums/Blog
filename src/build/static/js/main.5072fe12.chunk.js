The goal \n            of this discipline is to strike a balance between the body, mind and breath, with \n            the ultimate aim of attaining self-enlightment. It has been estimated by some \n            scholars that Yoga is about 5000 years old. Several scientists also claim that it is\n            a highly developed and scientific discipline for healthy living that has been\n            perfected through milleniums.','Lord Krishna says to Arjuna: "Howsoever men approach Me, even so do I reward them,\n            for, the path men take from every side, is mine, O Partha". The four paths are:\n            the path of work (Karma-Yoga), the path of devotion or love (Bhakti-Yoga), the path\n            of psychic control (Raja-Yoga) and the path of self-analysis and knowledge (Jnana-Yoga).',"Karma-Yoga: or the yoga of selfless action tells that through the correct actions, the\n            'troublemaker' ego can turn into the 'troubleshooter' ego. It says that even if you don't\n            believe in God, just focus on your work with utmost honesty, dedication and power of your\n            mind. Be non-attached and keep working for work's sake. Instead of worrying about the results,\n            leave the fruits of your work to the Lord.","Bhakti-Yoga: is the process of inner purification. Love is the vital element of all human\n            beings, it teaches. Love is pure and cosmic, but ego pollutes it and gives out negative elements\n            like lust, greed, jealousy and anger. God is the only one who truly loves us. Pour holy thoughts \n            into the mind with prayer, chant holy words, study holy books and keep the holy company close to\n            your heart.","Raja-Yoga: seeks to attain the divine by igniting the flame of knowledge of the self within. Most\n            seekers do not have the patience and perseverance to follow the path of reason. Teaching the process\n            of meditation and concentration, it tells you to confront the restlessness of the mind and uproot it.","Jnana-Yoga: is the path of Knowledge. Weeding out the darkness of ignorance through the light of\n            knowledge, it brings the 'fire' and 'light' alive by burning all the impuritied of the mind. The \n            mind does not give up its attachment to wordly pleasures unless it has tasted something greater and \n            higher.

Rich Vanilla aromas and sweetness separates Bourbon from other Whiskeys. It must be produced with\n            a mash containing atleast 51% of corn. It must be distilled to no more than 160 degree proof in charred new OAK containers\n            stored <125 degrees proof and bottled at not less that 80 proof.","Single Barrel:\n            These bottles of bourbon come from one barrel and are not blended with any others. Flavors will be different from barrel\n            to barrel within the same brand of single-barrel bourbon since the amount of pieces of wood, char in the barrel, and\n            conditions a barrel was aged will change. Blanton's was the first single-barrel bourbon to emerge onto the market\n            in the 1980's. Eagle Rare is a great example.","Cask Strength:\n            These bourbons can pack a punch and are known for being some of the most flavorful in the whiskey world. Before going \n            into the barrel bourbons are mixed with water to reduce the proof below the 125 proof regulation. During the aging process\n            the water will evaporate so when the barrel is emptied the spirit can be higher proof than when it entered. Before\n            bottling most bourbons are cut again with water to get to the distiller's desired proof. Not these guys. These are\n            full-flavor, intense, put-hair-on-your-chest type bourbons. Cask strength or barrel proof bourbon drinkers will\n            sometimes cut their pours with a few drops of water to get it to their own flavor preference. Since these come straight\n            from the barrel there tends to be a spice-forward palette with notes of the burn and char from the barrel. Example is\n            Maker's Mark Cask Strength Bourbon Whisky",'Wheated:\n            Otherwise known as \u201cwheaters" these are a type of bourbon where the distillers use wheat as the secondary ingredient\n            in the mashbill. This yields a less spicy, less sour, and less floral taste to the end product. These bourbons are\n            typically known for being nutty and soft on the palette. The holy grail of bourbon, Pappy Van Winkle Family Reserve,\n            is the most famous wheated bourbon. Example is Jim Beam Black',"High Rye:\n            The core ingredients of any bourbon is corn, barley, and rye. Traditional recipes tend to have about 10% rye but a few\n            bourbons go beyond this making for a more bold and almost spicy flavor. A few examples of high rye bottles you may have\n            heard of: Bulleit, Four Roses Single Barrel and Redemption High Rye Bourbon. Example is Bulleit Bourbon","High Corn:\n            Bourbon must be at least 51% corn according to regulations however a few go beyond that. These bourbons are known for\n            their sweet flavor. These bourbons are not however, to be confused with a different and distinct separate category of\n            whiskey called corn whiskey. We are a fan of the Hudson Baby Bourbon bottle hailing from New York state's Tuthilltown\n            Spirits and made with 100% New York corn. Example is Hudson Baby Bourbon Whiskey","Small Batch:\n            An increasingly familiar term in the world of bourbon, there is no real definition of what a \u201csmall-batch\" bourbon \n            actually is. It typically refers to a bourbon produced by mixing the contents of a small number of select barrels.\n            Compared a distillers' flagship bottle which could contain a bourbon mixture from hundreds or thousands of barrels,\n            this gives a distiller more freedom to experiment. Small batch bourbons are produced in less quantity and the distiller\n            will oftentimes note the batch or barrel number on the bottle. A couple of our small batch recommendations are Woodford\n            Reserve and Basil Haydens Kentucky Bourbon"]},{name:"React-Boilerplate",title:"Boilerplate options for React",content:["Create-React-App is the most common option, but there are many others.","Next js - new addition to react Eco-system attracting a good bit of attention.

They were the most sought-after animals during hunts in the past, but thanks to\n            increasing regulations, hunting has tremendously decreased, and it\u2019s becoming much easier to find the Big 5 while\n            visiting Africa.","Black Death -","The African Buffalo, or the Cape Buffalo, is one of the most unique creatures on the planet. They look bovine and timid, but do \n            not be fooled by their looks. These buffaloes are incredibly strong and ferocious when provoked. In fact, the African buffalo \n            is the most dangerous animal to hunt in the continent - more so than the hippopotamus!.\n            The buffalo's main predator is the lion, who must employ tactical methods to hunt them, especially to avoid the thick, bullet-proof\n            horns on its head!","African Elephant -","African elephants are the largest land animals on the planet, you will definitely be stunned by their size when you \n            finally get to see them. They are far larger than their Asian counterparts, and have distinctively larger ears that set\n            them apart.","Rhinoceros -","There are two types of rhinos in Africa: white and black rhino. Fun fact? Both of them have grey bodies. What sets them\n             apart is the shape of their lip: the white rhino has a square lip, whereas the black rhino has a pointed upper lip.\n            These rhinoceroses are enormous, and solitary. They look rather prehistoric in their structure- especially the black \n            rhinoceros, with its uniquely shaped horns. The rhinoceros are critically endangered due to years of poaching. \n            If the current conservation efforts do not work, the chances of extinction is high.","African Leopard -","The African leopard is a rather elusive creature- if you manage to view one when you are in Tanzania, you should \n            definitely consider yourself to be lucky. The leopard is the smallest of the big cats of the Serengeti. They are solitary\n            animals, who are fond of hunting at night time. If you go on a night time safari, you might even be able to see them on\n            the prowl. During the daytime, make sure you check the surrounding trees - leopards always use select trees as their bed\n            and dining table (as they draw their hunt to the top of the trees, to prevent scavengers and other animals from getting\n            them).","African Lion -","There are around 16,000 lions in Tanzania. They are the apex predators, and their daily lives are quite fascinating\n             for animal lovers. African lions are social animals and they live together in a pride.
